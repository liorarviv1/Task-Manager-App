Welcome to my MEAN stack web application project!
This project is designed to efficiently display users and their data, with a focus on managing todos and posts.

The application is built using the latest technologies, including Node.js for the backend, Express for the server, Angular for the frontend, and MongoDB for the database.
This stack provides a powerful and reliable foundation for the project, ensuring top performance and scalability.

One exciting feature of the application is that if all of a user's todos are completed, their border becomes blue.
This feature serves as a visual cue to encourage users to strive for completion and provides a sense of accomplishment when they reach their goals.

Additionally, the application has a search option, allowing users to quickly and easily find the information they need. This feature saves users time and enhances the overall user experience.

Overall, this MEAN stack web application is a powerful tool for managing todos and posts. With its intuitive design and cutting-edge technology, it's a must-have for anyone looking to increase productivity and streamline their workflow.

Thank you for considering my project. I'm excited to share it with the GitHub community and welcome any feedback or contributions.
